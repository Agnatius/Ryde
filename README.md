# Ryde: Uber-Like Ride Booking App with Real-Time Maps and Payments

ðŸš– Ryde is a full-stack ride-booking app. It blends a fast, Uber-like mobile UI with real-time location tracking, a secure payments flow, and robust data handling with PostgreSQL. Built with React Native and Expo on the front end, it uses Stripe for payments, Google Maps for routing, and a PostgreSQL backend for user data, rides, and history. The app emphasizes a clean user experience, reliability, and real-time responsiveness for drivers and riders alike.

What youâ€™ll build
- A mobile app with a clean, fast interface that mirrors popular ride-booking apps
- A real-time location system that updates rider and driver positions
- A payment flow using Stripe that handles secure tokenization and charges
- A map-based UI that shows routes, destinations, and live driver positions
- A backend that stores users, rides, payments, and ride history in PostgreSQL
- A developer experience that includes clear scripts, seed data, and test coverage

How Ryde works
- Real-time location tracking
  - The app sends periodic coordinates to the backend
  - The backend broadcasts updates to nearby drivers and the riderâ€™s interface
  - Location data is used to render live maps, route suggestions, and ETA estimates
- Ride lifecycle
  - Riders request rides through the UI
  - Drivers receive ride requests and accept or reject
  - The system tracks ride status: requested, accepted, en route, arrived, in-progress, completed, cancelled
  - Clear transitions update both rider and driver apps
- Payments
  - Riders attach a payment method via Stripe
  - The backend creates a payment intent when a ride completes
  - The riderâ€™s card is charged for the ride amount, with receipts stored in the userâ€™s history
- Maps and routing
  - Google Maps API provides map rendering, geocoding, and routing
  - Live route previews show estimated time of arrival and distance
- History and records
  - Each ride is stored with timestamps, locations, driver and rider IDs, and payment status
  - Riders can view past rides with route maps and receipts

  - Ride service orchestrates the ride lifecycle
  - Maps module manages map rendering and routes
  - Payments module handles all Stripe interactions
- Data flow
  - Client sends requests to create rides
  - Server validates and stores ride data
  - Real-time updates propagate to clients
  - On ride completion, payment is processed and receipts are generated
- Security considerations
  - Secrets stored securely on the server and in environment configuration
  - TLS for all API endpoints
  - Input validation and rate limiting
  - Audit logging for critical actions
- Testing philosophy
  - Unit tests for core logic
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - End-to-end tests for user flows (where feasible)
